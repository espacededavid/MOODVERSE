    "text": "A pale mist clung to the fields, blurring the edges of everything in sight. The world felt half-awake, stretching slowly into the day. A cup of warm tea cooled on the windowsill, swirling faint traces of steam into the chilly air. Somewhere in the distance, a lone car passed, its sound muffled and gentle. The morning didn\u2019t ask for anything\u2014just invited a quiet moment to exist peacefully.",
