    "text": "A single lantern swayed on the porch, casting a soft circle of amber light. The cicadas buzzed in the nearby trees, their song rising and falling like a gentle tide. The air was warm enough to feel comforting, but cool enough to breathe easily. As night settled in, the sky painted itself in deep blues. It was the kind of evening made for quiet thoughts and unhurried moments.",
