Usually I rush out of bed trying to catch up with everything, but this morning I just sat there under the blanket for a bit, letting my brain catch up. The house was quiet, and the sunlight coming through the blinds made everything feel softer. I made breakfast\u2014nothing fancy, just toast\u2014and ate by the window while scrolling through my messages. It wasn\u2019t an exciting morning, but for once, I didn\u2019t feel like I was behind on everything. It was kind of nice.",
