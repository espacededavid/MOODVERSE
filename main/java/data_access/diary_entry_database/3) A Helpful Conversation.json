    "text": "I ended up having a really good conversation with someone today. I didn\u2019t expect it to be anything deep\u2014I thought it would just be a quick chat\u2014but once we started talking, I realized how much I\u2019d been keeping to myself lately. It felt good to actually say things out loud instead of letting them rattle around in my head. They didn\u2019t try to give me dramatic advice or anything; they mostly just listened, which honestly helped more than anything. I walked away feeling lighter, like I\u2019d been carrying more than I realized.",
